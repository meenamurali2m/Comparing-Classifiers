# Comparing-Classifiers

##Business Objective

The objective of this project is to optimize the predictive performance of various classifiers for predicting the success of a bank marketing campaign. The campaign aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product based on their characteristics (e.g., demographic data, past behavior). The classifiers compared in this project are:

. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
. Logistic Regression
. Decision Trees
. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

By comparing the performance of these models, we aim to determine the best classification model to accurately predict customer responses and improve the bank's marketing campaign's effectiveness.

##Dataset##
The dataset used for this project is related to marketing bank products over the telephone. 
UCI Machine Learning repository link for bank-additional-full.xls

The features include various customer attributes such as:
Demographic information (e.g., age, job, marital status)
Contact-related information (e.g., duration of the call, contact communication method)
Previous marketing campaign results (e.g., whether the customer subscribed to a product in a past campaign)
The target variable is whether or not the customer will subscribe to the product during the current marketing campaign.

##Project Workflow##
Step 1: Understanding the Data
Step 2: Read in the Data
Step 3: Understanding the Features
determine if any of the features are missing values or need to be coerced to a different data type
Step 4: Problem 4: Understanding the Task
Compare the Performance of Classifiers in Predicting Marketing Success for Bank Products, by optimizing the predictive performance of various classifiers to enhance a marketing campaign aimed at selling bank products over the telephone.

Problem 5: Engineering Features and Visualization
Now that you understand your business objective, we will build a basic model to get started. Before we can do this, we must work to encode the data. Using just the bank information features, prepare the features and target column for modeling with appropriate encoding and transformations.

Step 6: Train/Test Split
Step 7: A Baseline Model
Step 8: A Simple Model - Logistic
Step 9: Score the Model
Step 10: Model Comparisons
Four classifiers are trained and evaluated:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A distance-based algorithm that classifies data points based on their neighbors.

Logistic Regression: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., subscribed or not).

Decision Trees: A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data based on feature values.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that seeks to find a hyperplane that best separates the data points into classes.

Step 3: Performance Metrics
For each model, the following metrics are computed:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.

Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions relative to all positive predictions.

Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions relative to all actual positive instances.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

Train Time: The time it takes to train the model on the dataset.

Test Time: The time it takes to make predictions on the test data.

Step 4: Hyperparameter Tuning
For some models, hyperparameter tuning is performed using Grid Search to find the optimal settings, particularly for models like KNN and Decision Trees.

Step 5: Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on the selected metrics, and the best-performing model is identified.

The results are visualized using graphs and tables to compare the performance of each model across different metrics.

Step 6: Conclusion
The best classifier for predicting customer subscription to a bank product is selected based on its accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.
